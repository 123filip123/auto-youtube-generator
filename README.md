# Auto YouTube Generator

## Overview

This project automatically generates YouTube Shorts-style videos based on a topic you provide. It uses OpenAI APIs to generate a list of items, create images and audio, and then assembles them into a vertical video suitable for YouTube Shorts.

**Pipeline steps:**

1. Generate a list of items (with titles, descriptions, and image prompts) for your topic.
2. Generate audio narration for each item using OpenAI's TTS API.
3. Generate images for each item using OpenAI's image generation API.
4. Save all generated data.
5. Create titled images for each item.
6. Assemble everything into a vertical video (9:16) with smooth transitions and effects.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/123filip123/auto-youtube-generator.git
   cd auto-youtube-generator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   For Windows (also make sure you have Python set up in Path):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel (do this for windows if you have issues)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## OpenAI API Key Setup

This app requires access to the OpenAI API for text, image, and audio generation. You must set your API key as an environment variable.

1. **Create a `.env` file in the project root:**

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Alternatively, export the variable in your shell:**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## How to Run the App

### Run the Full Pipeline (Recommended)

This will prompt you for a topic and number of items, then run the entire process:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Run Individual Steps

You can also run each step separately using the provided scripts:

- **Generate list:**
  ```bash
  python run_generate_list.py
  ```
- **Generate audio:**
  ```bash
  python run_generate_audio.py
  ```
- **Generate images:**
  ```bash
  python run_generate_images.py
  ```
- **Create titled images:**
  ```bash
  python run_create_titled_images_short.py
  ```
- **Save generated data:**
  ```bash
  python run_save_to_generated_data.py
  ```
- **Generate video:**
  ```bash
  python run_generate_video_short.py
  ```

---

## Output

- Generated data (JSON, images, audio, video) will be saved in the `outputs/` and `generated_data/` directories.
- The final video will be in `outputs/video_output/`.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (required by moviepy; install via `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS or your OS package manager)

---

## Notes

- Make sure your OpenAI account has access to the required APIs (GPT-4, TTS, image generation).
- If you encounter errors related to API limits, try reducing the number of items or add delays between requests.
- For best results, use a topic that is suitable for list-style videos (e.g., "Amazing Space Facts").
